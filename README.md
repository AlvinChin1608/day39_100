# day39_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# Flight Price Tracker
This project tracks flight prices for various destinations using the Amadeus API and Google Sheets. It sends notifications via SMS or WhatsApp when a lower price is found.

1. Use Sheety to Read and Write Data to the Google Sheet
2. Get the IATA codes using Amadeus
3. Search for cheap Flights
4. If the price is lower than in the sheet, send a message

## Google Sheet
This sheet allows users to input a city name, it will automatically generate the corresponding IATA code and set a flight budget for notifications.
